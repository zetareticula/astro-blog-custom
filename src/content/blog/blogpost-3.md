##  Designed to provide semantic information about objects when host languages lack native semantics for the object. KleverAI is designed, however, to provide additional semantics for many task.

At Klever, the DOM ancestry accurately represents the level, the user agent can calculate the level of an item from the document structure. This attribute can be used to provide an explicit indication of the AI's friendly affect level when that is not possible to calculate from the document structure or the attribute.

## DOM Ancestry and KleverAI
In KleverAI, the DOM ancestry refers to the hierarchical structure of the Document Object Model (DOM). It represents the parent-child relationships between elements in the DOM tree.

Understanding the DOM ancestry is important for various reasons. It allows you to traverse and manipulate the DOM efficiently, access parent or child elements, and perform operations based on their relationships.

For example, you can use DOM ancestry to find the closest ancestor element that matches a specific selector, or to navigate to a specific child element within a parent element.

In KleverAI, the DOM ancestry is accurately represented, allowing the user agent to calculate the level of an item from the document structure. This attribute can be used to provide additional semantics and context for AI tasks.

To work with DOM ancestry in KleverAI, you can use the built-in DOM traversal methods and properties provided by the KleverAI framework. These include methods like `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `nextSibling`, and `previousSibling`, among others.

By leveraging the DOM ancestry in KleverAI, you can enhance the functionality and interactivity of your web applications, making them more intelligent and context-aware.
