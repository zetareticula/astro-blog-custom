 The work of the current task forces at KleverAI are tailored for Mobile Accessibility needs implementing a Low Vision Accessibility dialog prompt show.
 
the importance of combined consideration of content, user interface, extensions, applications and user agents.



## Consideration of content

- Accessibility guidelines should be followed to ensure that content is perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
- Semantic HTML should be used to provide meaningful structure and information to assistive technologies.
- Alternative text should be provided for images to describe their content to visually impaired users.
- Proper heading structure should be used to create a logical outline of the content.
- Keyboard accessibility should be implemented to allow users to navigate and interact with the content using only the keyboard.

-   The user can choose to reposition individual controls within containers (e.g. toolbars or tool palettes)



## For those who can customize ther LLM to Simplicity.


The user can choose to display any controls available within the user agent user interface, including user-installed add-ons.
